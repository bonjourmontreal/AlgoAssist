# AlgoAssist

## Project Overview

AlgoAssist is an interactive visualizer built to help users understand sorting and pathfinding algorithms through clear and engaging visual demonstrations. Designed for educational purposes, AlgoAssist offers a hands-on approach to learning complex algorithms, making it perfect for students, educators, and enthusiasts. The project leverages Pygame and runs as a standalone app, providing an intuitive interface to explore the mechanics of both sorting and pathfinding in real time.

## Features

- **Two-in-One Visualizer:** AlgoAssist combines both a sorting and pathfinding app in a single platform. Users can easily switch between exploring sorting algorithms and pathfinding algorithms.

- **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer:** Explore 12 sorting algorithms, customize speed, list size, and sorting order, and track real-time metrics like comparisons and array accesses. Step mode allows for step-by-step visualization of sorting.

- **Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer:** Choose from 6 pathfinding algorithms, 4 heuristics, and 4 maze generation methods. Customize mazes, track visited nodes and path length, and visualize algorithm performance in real-time.

- **Educational Focus:** Designed for students and enthusiasts, AlgoAssist provides algorithm insights, making complex concepts easier to grasp through interactive learning.


## Tech Stack

**Language:** Python

**Framework/Library:** Pygame

**Development Environment:** Runs as a standalone app

## Distinctiveness and Complexity


AlgoAssist goes beyond typical course projects with its interactive, customizable visualizations, real-time metrics, and in-depth algorithm insights, offering a more engaging learning experience.

  - **Two-in-One Platform**: AlgoAssist integrates both sorting and pathfinding algorithms into a single application, allowing users to seamlessly switch between exploring different algorithm types, making it versatile and comprehensive.

  - **Step-by-Step Visualization**: With Step Mode, users can slow down and examine each individual step of sorting algorithms, making it easy to understand how comparisons and swaps occur, providing a deeper insight into algorithm mechanics.

  - **Color-Coded Visualizations**: Intuitive color schemes enhance the learning process by highlighting key elements. In sorting, colors indicate elements being compared, swapped, or finalized. In pathfinding, different colors show visited nodes, nodes to visit, and the final path, making it easy to track algorithm progress.

  - **Customizable Features**: AlgoAssist provides extensive customization for both sorting and pathfinding algorithms. Select from 12 sorting algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Heap Sort) with options to adjust speed, list size, and sorting order. In the pathfinding app, choose from 6 algorithms (e.g., A*, Dijkstra), modify heuristics, and select from various maze generation methods. Users can also create custom mazes by adding barriers for more tailored algorithm testing.

  - **Real-Time Metrics**: Get live feedback on performance. In sorting, the app displays comparisons and array accesses in real-time, while in pathfinding, it tracks the number of nodes visited and the path length when a solution is found.

  - **Detailed Algorithm Insights**: For both sorting and pathfinding, users can access time complexity, space complexity, and common applications, bridging the gap between theoretical learning and practical understanding.

  - **Maze Generation & Customization**: The pathfinding app includes 4 maze generation algorithms and allows users to create custom barrier placements, encouraging users to experiment and see how algorithms perform in varied environments.

In summary, AlgoAssist offers an intuitive interface, detailed visualizations, and customizable settings, making it an ideal tool for students, educators, and enthusiasts looking to explore and understand sorting and pathfinding algorithms in-depth.
